# Facebook-Data-Analysis
I have done the Facebook Data Analysis using the Pseudo Data in R.
Instead of using R-studio I tried doing the analysis in Juypter.To create a R notebook in Juypter at first you need to do following steps
1.Run the following commands in R-Studio
   install.packages('devtools')
   devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
   IRkernel::installspec()  # to register the kernel in the current R installation
   
2.Once all the commands are executed succesfully,you can go to juypter and create new R notebook similar to that of Python notebook

You can open the Facebook_Data_Analysis.ipynb file load the data file and see the analysis.
